I'm Firhan, a second year fast track master's student at Brawijaya University I spend my time mainly on researching AI architectures and methods, particularly in **Natural Language Processing** and **Low Resource Deep Learning Models**.

I don't stop at thinking multiple scenarios, solutions, and possibilities. **I dive head first to experiment them myself**, mostly because the addictive nature of discovery and the learning process.

Based on those experiences, **I develop solutions that address technical challenges**, whether it's a text preprocessing pipeline that reduces the training time of many machine learning models, a server log parsing system for cybersecurity analysis, or an adaptation of LLM quantization framework for diffusion models to minimize GPU cost.
